Bellius sent his warriors through the bottleneck first. A wise move, designed
to wear Nesta down.
She had no choice but to meet them.
There were no hateful voices in her head. Only the knowledge that her
friends lay behind her, beyond the line she’d drawn in the earth, and she
would not cede that line to these males.
She would not fail her friends. She had no room for fear in her heart.
Only calm. Determination.
And love.
Nesta’s lips curved in a smile as the first of the warriors ran at her,
sword raised. She was still smiling when she lifted her shield to take the full
impact of the blow.
Nesta slammed her shield into the first male, sliced the shins of the
second, and dispatched the third with a parry that sent him careening into the
fourth and both of them tumbling to the ground. One for each breath, a
movement for each inhale and exhale. She stilled her mind again, let it root
her.
For a heartbeat, she wondered what she might have done with Ataraxia
in her hand. What she might do with this body, these skills trained into her
bones. If she was worthy of the sword at last.
She’d opted for a name in the Old Language, a tongue no one had
spoken in fifteen thousand years. A name Lanthys had laughed to hear.
Nesta engaged four of the Illyrians at once, then five, then six, and the
males started to go down, one after another. Nesta held the line in a storm of
unflinching focus and death, guarding the friends at her back.
Ataraxia, she had named that magic sword.
